This is a Next.js-based travel application with TypeScript that helps users search for trips, manage bookings, view travel guides, and track points. The application uses React components, server components, and client components as part of the Next.js App Router architecture. Please follow these guidelines when contributing:

## Code Standards

### Required Before Each Commit
- Run `npm run lint` to ensure code follows project standards
- Make sure all components follow Next.js App Router patterns
- Client components should be marked with 'use client' when they use browser APIs or React hooks
- When adding new functionality, make sure you update the README
- Make sure that the repository structure documentation is correct and accurate in the Copilot Instructions file
- Ensure all tests pass by running `npm run test` in the terminal

### TypeScript and React Patterns
- Use TypeScript interfaces/types for all props and data structures
- Follow React best practices (hooks, functional components)
- Use proper state management techniques
- Components should be modular and follow single-responsibility principle

### Styling
- You must prioritize using Tailwind CSS classes as much as possible. If needed, you may define custom Tailwind Classes / Styles. Creating custom CSS should be the last approach.

## Development Flow
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Development server: `npm run dev`
